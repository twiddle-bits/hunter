How does Hunter affect end users which do usually run ``*.msu`` or ``*.dmg``
installers?  The answer - it doesn't at all. Hunter in fact do quite the same
stuff that developer do with packages: download, build, install, reuse in other
projects.  There will be no new functionality introduced by package - it will
be installed in the same way as system package manager or custom build script do.
But giving you much more control and allow you experimenting seamlessly. From
some point of view Hunter is like adding unit-testing to your project. The is
no way to determine by end product does it use testing or not. However probably
users will notice result effect - quality of product.
